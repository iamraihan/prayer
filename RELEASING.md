# Releasing — maintainer guide

How to publish a new version of Prayer Times. The whole process is ~2 minutes
of work; GitHub Actions does the building for all platforms.

> **TL;DR** — bump the version in 3 files → commit → push → check CI is green
> → tag → push the tag. Done.

## One-time setup (already done — do not repeat)

| What | Where | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Updater signing keypair | `~/.tauri/prayer-times.key` (+ `.pub`) | Generated with `pnpm tauri signer generate`. **Backed up somewhere safe** — see warning below. |
| Public key | `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` → `plugins.updater.pubkey` | Baked into every build; verifies update signatures. |
| `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` secret | GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions | Lets the Release workflow sign update files. |

⚠️ **Never lose the private key.** Every app already installed only trusts
updates signed with it. If it's lost, all existing installs lose auto-updates
forever and must reinstall manually.

## Every release, step by step

Say the next version is `0.3.0`:

1. **Bump the version to `0.3.0` in all three files** (keep them identical):

   | File | Field |
   | ---- | ----- |
   | `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` | `"version"` ← the one the updater reads |
   | `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` | `version` |
   | `package.json` | `"version"` |

   Quick check: `grep '"version"' package.json src-tauri/tauri.conf.json && grep '^version' src-tauri/Cargo.toml`

   (Optional but tidy: `cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
   once so `Cargo.lock` records the new version too.)

2. **Commit and push:**

   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "release v0.3.0"
   git push
   ```

3. **Wait for CI to go green** (Actions tab → "CI"). Never tag a red build.

4. **Tag and push the tag — the tag number must match the files:**

   ```bash
   git tag v0.3.0
   git push origin v0.3.0
   ```

5. **Watch the Release workflow** (Actions tab → "Release"). Four parallel
   builds run: Windows, Ubuntu, macOS (Apple Silicon + Intel). Takes ~15–20 min.

6. **Check the result** on the Releases page: installers for all platforms,
   plus the signed update files and `latest.json` that installed apps check.

Users' apps detect the update on their next launch: a banner appears, the
update downloads inside the app (Windows/Linux AppImage) and the app restarts.
On macOS the app links to the release page (silent updates there need a paid
Apple Developer ID certificate).

## Choosing the version number

| Bump | Use when | Example |
| ---- | -------- | ------- |
| Patch `0.3.0 → 0.3.1` | bug fix, small tweak | fixed alarm not firing |
| Minor `0.3.0 → 0.4.0` | new feature, settings option | added new notification type |
| Major `0.x → 1.0` | big milestone / breaking change | first "stable" release |

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| ------- | ----- | --- |
| `git push` to main rejected (`GH006: Protected branch`) | Your user is missing from the ruleset bypass list | Settings → Rules → Rules → edit ruleset → Bypass list → add `iamraihan` |
| Release workflow fails at signing (`missing private key` / env var error) | `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` secret missing or wrong content | Re-add the secret; content must be the **entire** `~/.tauri/prayer-times.key` file |
| Workflow says version/tag mismatch or creates a different tag | Tag number ≠ version in `tauri.conf.json` | Delete the tag (below), fix files, re-tag |
| Tagged by mistake / want to redo | — | `git tag -d v0.3.0` (local), `git push origin :refs/tags/v0.3.0` (remote), delete the release on GitHub if it was created, then fix and re-tag |
| Linux build fails: `Package alsa was not found` or another missing system library | A system dev package missing from the workflow's `apt-get install` list | Add the package in **both** `.github/workflows/release.yml` and `ci.yml`, commit, then delete and re-push the tag (re-runs use the old workflow file) |
| Users don't see the update | They installed a version from before the updater existed (e.g. 0.1.0) | Those users must download v0.2.0+ manually once — from then on updates are automatic |
| CI red | Code problem | Fix and push **before** tagging; never release on red |

## Notes

- Tags point at a commit — the version bump commit is what gets tagged, so
  always **tag last**, after pushing the bump.
- The Release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) only triggers on tags
  matching `v*`. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every push to main
  and every PR.
- `.cargo/config.toml` is machine-local (gitignored) — the repo must never
  carry build-output redirects like the old `E:/cargo-target` path; it breaks
  the CI/build runners.
